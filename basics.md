# Basics

## Working hours

As we are a service company our clients expect a consistent set of hours of availability. We ask
your working day is a continuous set of hours (except of a lunch break of course), between the hours
of 10 am and 4 pm; i.e. if you would like to finish at 4 pm, start work at 7:30 am.

## Vacations

Vacation dates have to be planned at least 3 months in advance and approved by Management to 
avoid resource planning conflicts.  Days have to be accrued in order to take vacation.
