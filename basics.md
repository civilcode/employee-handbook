## Working hours

As we are a service company our clients expect a consistent set of hours of availability. We ask
your working day is a continuous set of hours (except of a lunch break of course), between the hours
of 10 am and 4 pm; i.e. if you would like to finish at 4 pm, start work at 7:30 am.
