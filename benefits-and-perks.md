# Benefits & Perks

Benefits and perks are only available to Canadians with a full-time employment contract.

## Benefits

### Health Insurance

Health insurance is provided by SunLife. The company pays 50% of the premium and the employee pays the other 50%.  Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered equally.

### Summer Hours

During summer, we finish at noon on Fridays, aka "summer hours". Summer hours are in effect from July 1 through August 31 each year. (An employee who has just been hired may have to complete a training program per their team lead to be eligible). When a holiday occurs during summers hours, the Friday is a full working day.

To be eligible to finish at noon, the employee must be present in the morning. If the employee wishes to take a vacation day on Friday, that will be counted as a full-day against their vacation allowance.

## Practical assistance

### Home Office Set-up

If you work remotely in a different city, we want to make sure your home office is comfortable. You can expense up to $1,000 to furnish your home office, every three years.

### Coworking Space Stipend

For remote employees, CivilCode will pay up to $200/month for you to use towards renting coworking space in your city. Please make sure you're using a true coworking space that's meant solely for working, not a club or social space and must be appropriate for pair programming.

### Expenses

CivilCode has no expense policy. We trust our employees to spend money wisely. If you’re booking a flight, you don’t need to buy the cheapest, 2-layover redeye; buy the convenient, well-priced seat. If you’re attending a conference on behalf of CivilCode, sure, CivilCode will buy your meals. Try to limit conference travel to once a year, and don't extend your hotel stay too far to either side of the conference schedule.
