# Office

This page describes policies around the office.

## Temperature

During the hotter months the air conditioning thermostat is set to 75F (approx 24C).

[CNESS](https://qpat-apeq.qc.ca/health-safety-at-work/) states that by law there is a minimum
temperature of 20C for office work. There is no maximum temperature requirement.

We understand that everybody has a different preference in temperature, but as we share a
space we cannot accommodate individual requirements.
