# Notes

Questions to keep in mind (from [here](https://suechoeblog.com/2016/11/10/why-im-obsessed-with-competency-matrices-or-how-competency-matrices-help-your-employees-to-learn-and-your-company-to-scale/)):

“I’m not growing here professionally.”
“I don’t know what I need to do to grow in my role.”
“I don’t understand why that person got promoted and I didn’t.”
“The feedback my manager gives me isn’t actionable.”
